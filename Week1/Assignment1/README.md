-Short reflection
This is not my first time using p5.js to create something, which I am thankful for, as I really don’t enjoy working in this software. It feels very time-consuming and tedious, and I believe I could create a better design using a different software. Creatively speaking, it is really hard to do that in this software, as it takes a lot of work to get everything placed and scaled correctly in a short amount of time. The patience and technical work required is not extreme, although if not done correctly, it can be a real roadblock.
 Comparatively speaking, my art utilizes the entire scene, unlike the A.I.-generated art, which uses only the center portion to deliver a disappointing kitty. Poor cat… You would think that with the brain an A.I. has, it would be able to create a more complex image. As you can see clearly, even my second generation did not utilize its ability and still provided a pretty terrible looking cat. Goes to show that no matter how advanced the A.I. is it just doesn’t have the same fine-tune we have when it comes to being creative!
