Reflection
	When working with p5.js, a lot of it is trial and error until it gets into the more complicated stuff. Tweaking with the variables usually helps me solve my problems faster than trying to research everything about everything. When creating my animation there were problems with keeping everything together as one whole cat. Using push and pop fixed this issue although it still is confusing to me as to why I only had to add it to a couple of shapes and not everything else. 

	The A.I.-generated sketch resembled a sketch that met the assignment's requirements in a simple, efficient way. One thing that I liked about the animation that it created was that it always had movement. I incorporated this into my thought process when creating my design. The random movement of each of the shapes puzzled me as to how to go about incorporating having each of my shapes be at different locations in the animation. 

	Overall, seeing how an A.I. handles the assignment really helped me visualize how I wanted my final product to look and act. Thank you!
